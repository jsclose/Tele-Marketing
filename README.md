# Tele-Marketing
We will be looking at Tele-Marketing Data and attempt to predict whether the tele-marketing call will be successful or not. 

We have information on more than 41,000 tele-marketing calls made by a bank to sell a product called term deposit. The data has information on which of these calls were actually successful in making a sale. As tele-marketing has very low conversion rates typically, if we can predict whether a customer is likely to buy or not, we can focus our tele-marketing efforts towards more willing buyers and save/make a ton of money.
